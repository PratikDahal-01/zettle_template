# Bob Doto provides a good short read on How to Use a [[Zettelkasten]] 
(here I will use another format; as I do not have the correct page no. as I had read a epub file and it does not have consistent page number -> Also this will signify that being stuck in one format is not essential, what we want is to write down our thoughts; although being one keeps everything uniform)

### Brief on notes and creation of them
There are mainly 3 types of notes:
- [[Fleeting Notes]]
	- [[Inbox]]
	- [[Sleeping]]
- [[Reference |Reference/Resource Note]]
- [[Permanent Notes]] (bob calls them main notes)

To take the notes we must read with:
- Question / Problem to solve -> But not be bound to just that if we find something that is interesting capture that as well 
- Capture things we disagree with -> So that we do not fall into [[conformation bias]] making our analysis skewed else
- What the author was thinking -> Same text can be interpreted in different manner(depending on the time you read; let alone different person) but even then trying to look inside the authors head is a great way to learn something
- Read someone else’s interpretation -> Extending on the previous point this opens up our horizon to greater insights (keep this in `Resources` folder as well)
- Read how you interpret things -> Don’t force yourself to think like someone else just capture what you think after reading a text
- Try to create a synergy of Author and our experience to generate new things
- Read Fiction -> This is important as it will help us think outside the box sometimes 
> Feel free to scribble on the book, but comeback to retrieve it later to put in our [[Zettelkasten]] 

Make working with [[Permanent Notes|Main Notes]] more useful, connectable and joyful to work with by:
- Adding context as to why these two notes I think are linked together, i.e. mention a short line why 2 ideas are related when making the connection

> [!success] Naming a main note
> Give the title of the main note after we have finished with the content of it @end which will be the rough summary types of what the note has
> Main notes can be directly created one after another as and when good ideas emerge (hence the option when `ctrl + n`)
> There is no such thing as a perfect main note, the linking of main notes is what is the most important

Our [[Zettelkasten]] will and should have questions in them :
- They need to be answered
- Even if they are not answered we should write something about the question itself 

### Working with facts
Re-state them in our own words; picture how it works for you and then incorporate it into our notes
- Keep on layering(adding more context by asking why) on the facts till they start to make sense on a personal level
	- An example from the book itself:
	- Fact: Arteries are thicker than veins (remembering this is quite hard)
		- But if we understand that the heart pumps the blood from arteries, it is easier to understand that arteries need to sustain more pressure hence they have thicker walls


### Ideas
The whole premise of this system is to facilitate and make our ideas work with each other hence, ~={11}if something feels more prominent to generate new ideas fell free to break the rules =~
- Create new ideas whether they are parallel or tangent to what we already know
- Extending [[New notes have the essence of previous notes but with differences]] if there is a mistake then also do the same let the mistake note remain and create a new note -> This way we will see how we embrace the [[Growth Mindset]] 
- We need not be fully aware of a topic to add a note about it in the [[Zettelkasten]], just feel free to add the note and then see where all of this leads to -> Trying to make connections is what is the most important 

### Connections
This is the most important part of working with the ideas, as obsidian is such a great tool use connections how so ever we want; the only caveat is that ~={red}Be sure to add a small note as to how the note(s) is/are connected with each other=~ 
- Once a new note is written/added to [[Permanent Notes]] think of ways to connect to and fro from this note 
- Connection of ideas can happen only when we have atomicity in [[Permanent Notes#^0da4a9]] 
- Ideas and connections are related: Ideas are a collection of atomic statements that when taken out of context, even than they will mean something (ideas are formed due to connections of Atomic statements) 
- As ideas propagate new ideas come from the previous, which all need to be linked 

### Imp:
- Stop thinking about the constraints of topic, any topic can be the starting point of the chain of thoughts, that is the beauty of [[Zettelkasten]] we can link any note with anything -> Mixing and matching of ideas happen which lead to untrodden lands
- Once placed the notes will not move (by placed in mean in the category), even if we think that it suits to be in this category, nope now it belongs to this category only we will link to the note from a note in the other category
	- This is done in-order that we do not worry about the order that the notes are in, of course we can move around the note to different category but that will lead to further indecision to where should this be, leading us astray of the very thing we want to do
- The notes are created as randomly as the thoughts pop up in our head 
- We have category(this is called label by bob doto) which are in the property of the note itself do not think that we will need to structure the notes in a category in some order which will make sense it is not a tree hence there is no hierarchical structure to category as well (stoicism and philosophy although having a sort of hierarchical structure I will never structure the notes so that they are linear structure; if I talk about stoicism first then they will come up on top)
- When we assign a `category` property to a note what we are doing is that saying this this note falls under this category we are not saying how it falls, it is just there (like [Paulo Maldini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Maldini) and [Daniel Maldini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Maldini) they will fall under the footballer `category`; but in the category list I will not mention that they have a father son relation, nor will I say how they are footballers; I will mention that in their respective note)

### Navigation of Notes
Use the concept of ~={red}Anarch: Leverage the chaos for our benefit=~
- As every note is a part of a [[Lattice of Mental Model]](lattice means a structure that is connected) each individual [[Permanent Notes]] is a point of contact (notes lead to it) and divergent (it leads to other notes)
- No single note dominates other notes
- The stability in this chaos is generated through the relations
In a gist it works as follows(this is called [rhizome](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)>)):
- Enter any point whatsoever
- None matter more than another
- Discover other points the entrance point to

### Supporting type of Notes(created for special causes):
- [[Hub Notes]]
- [[Structure Notes]]
