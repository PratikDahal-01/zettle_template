There are 2 types of Retention:
- Short Term: Remember the things for a week 
- Long Term: Keeping what you’ve learnt in the mind 

# Techniques Are:
### Spacing 
> [!caution]
> Never Cram Anything
- Spreading the learning session over longer periods of time, causes lower performance in the short run, but in the long this is the most beneficial 
- ~={cyan}Space your study sessions too closely, and you lose efficiency; space them too far apart, and you forget what you’ve already learned.=~ 
- Try to link everything to each other, with the book closed as in [[Retrieval]] 

### Proceduralization
- Means that making the skill a process 
- Skills transition from being a novice -> expert (in expert the skill is akin to a procedure i.e. not much cognitive resources are to be spent) 
	- Be like this, also a procedural skill remains permanently, in the brain rather than the ones which are not procedural 
- ~={red}Failing to proceduralize, is the major factor why skills do not stick with us=~
- Some skills cannot be completely automated and will always require some conscious thought, make the accompanying steps a procedure
- ~={cyan}Ensure that a certain amount of knowledge is completely proceduralized before practice concludes.=~
- Another approach might be to spend extra effort to proceduralize some skills, which will serve as cues or access points for other knowledge.

### Overlearning 
- It refers to the additional practice that facilitates over the current skill, i.e. beyond what is required and needed
- This facilitates the skill being engraved into the brain
- ~={yellow}Practicing a little longer in one session produces an additional week or two of recall=~
- This works well with [[Directness]] 
- There are two main methods:
	- Core Practice:
		- Continually practicing and refining the core elements of a skill. This approach often works well paired with some kind of immersion or working on extensive (as opposed to intensive) projects, after the initial ultralearning phase has been completed.
	- Moving up a level:
		- Learning a topic that is a superset of the current skill ensures that the previous set of skills remains and it is retained

### Mnemonics 
- Self Explanatory
