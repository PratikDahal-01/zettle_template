This means that being in close accordance to what the exact environment or the Implication of the skill is in, as a holistic system

Increase this(directness) gradually 

## Transfer (Can be done after the completion of the Learning Project)

Transfer is a problem, which needs to be solved by the educational institutes

## Avoiding the Problem associated with Transfer
~={red}To be More Immersive & Simulative=~

| This is Why I learned this topic in this Project | Here is how this is done in what I want to do | Here is How I did it | Direct Environment / Simulation |
