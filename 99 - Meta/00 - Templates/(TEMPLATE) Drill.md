![[Drill#Follow Direct-then-Drill Approach]]
Many attempts to isolate a drill may end in failure because the drill doesn’t really cut at the heart of what was difficult in real practice. That’s okay; this feedback is important to help you minimize wasting time learning things that don’t matter much to your end goals.

A Table to gauge all the various ways of this above way:

| Skill Learned | Directness | Drill (The Isolated rate-determining step) | The Feedback from the Drill | Did it improve the Directness |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
|               |            |                                            |                             |                               |
|               |            |                                            |                             |                               |

## Designing Drills
- Firstly understand the Rate Determining step: ![[Drill#^6ce887]]
- Determining what to drill may seem tricky, but it doesn’t have to be. The key is to experiment.

| For this skill | This may be holding me back (Hypothesis) | Improved on that skill (which was holding me back)? | If yes on the previous, did it improve the overall holistic process in [[Directness]], ~={red}if yes: That was the correct Rate Determining Step=~ |

#### Technique 1: Time Slicing
Look for parts of the skill you’re learning that can be decomposed into specific moments of time that have heightened difficulty or importance.
For eg: During Football Practice taking Penalty kicks, it is practicing itself but we have set aside a Time for a prolonged amount of time, to do this one task to improve our game
~={green}Think how we can objectify it so that it can be written and observed=~

#### Technique 2: Cognitive Components
- The tactic here is to find a way to drill only one component when, in practice (of that component), others(that constitute of the skill that we are learning) would be applied at the same time.
- ~={red}Bit of an oddball=~

#### Technique 3: Copycat
- A difficulty with drills in many creative skills is that it is often impossible to practice one aspect without also doing the work of the others.
- ~={yellow}Solution=~: By copying the parts of the skill you don’t want to drill (either from someone else or your past work), you can focus exclusively on the component you want to practice. Not only does this save a lot of time, because you need to repeat only the part you’re drilling, it also reduces your cognitive burden, meaning you can apply more focus to getting better at that one aspect.
- Example: If I want to practice just my theoretical knowledge of a subject, I will conveniently just copy a diagram and then explain the same to myself, rather than drawing the whole diagram

#### Technique 4: Prerequisite Channing
- Start with a skill that we don’t have all the prerequisites for.
- When we inevitably do poorly, they go back a step, learn one of the foundational topics, and repeat the exercise.
- By doing so, you know what the Prerequisite is for and what to drill, and what to gracefully ignore
