### When & How?
~={9}When did I Procrastinate and how did I react=~
Take steps to resist the impulse. One way is to think in terms of a series of “crutches” or mental tools that can help you get through some of the worst parts of your tendency to procrastinate.

### Why ?
~={9}What was the reason that I procrastinated=~ 
A first crutch comes from recognizing that most of what is unpleasant in a task (if you are averse to it) or what is pleasant about an alternative task (if you’re drawn to distraction) is an impulse that doesn’t actually last that long.
~={cyan}Convince to just get through the initial few minutes of maximal unpleasantness before taking a break=~
- Do use the Pomodoro timer click the stopwatch (2nd Last) on the left ribbon 
- After that set strict schedule using calendar app or something like Morgen
	- If you find yourself setting a daily schedule with chunked hours and then frequently ignore it to do something else, go back to the start and try building back up again with the five-minute rule and then the Pomodoro Technique followed by the Schedule
