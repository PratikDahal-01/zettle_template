Various Techniques can be used:
#### 1. Flash Cards
- Understand that they work well only for a particular type of retrieval: when there’s a pairing between a specific cue and a particular response. 
#### 2. Free Recall
- After reading through a paper/after a lecture in a blank page write down everything that you recall.
- Free recall like this is often very difficult, and there will be many things missed, even if you just finished reading the text in question.
- By forcing yourself to recall the main points and arguments, you’ll be able to remember them better later.

#### 3. The Question-Book Method
- While taking notes instead of copying the main points as we encounter them take them in the form of questions
- Eg: Instead of writing that the Magna Carta was signed in 1215, you could instead write the question “When was the Magna Carta signed?”
- ~={red}Used the Cloze Plugin, select a text and then click `ctrl+shift+c`=~
- There can be: one question per section of a text, thus forcing myself to acknowledge and rephrase the main point rather than zoom in on a detail that will be largely irrelevant later.

#### 4. Self Generated Challenges
- The above work for remembering things but, if you want to learn then that is not enough
- As and when going through the passive material, create challenges for yourself to solve later

| Technique | Challenge |
| --------- | --------- |

#### 5. Closed Book Learning
- Any learning activity can become an opportunity for retrieval if you cut off the ability to search for hints.

> Keep the reference as closed as possible, only refer to them if the situation is dire
