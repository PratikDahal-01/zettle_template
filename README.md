# Zettelkasten
This is my interpretation of the [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) that is talked about in these book(s):
- [How To take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.in/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Technique/dp/3982438802) 
- [A System For Writing](https://www.amazon.in/System-Writing-Unconventional-Note-Making-Zettelkasten-ebook/dp/B0D18J83VB)

I have taken components from various sources to create this vault(I don’t quite remember) but these are few:
- [Cyan Voxel](https://www.youtube.com/@CyanVoxel)
- [bramses](https://github.com/bramses/bramses-highly-opinionated-vault-2023) 
- And all the plugins
