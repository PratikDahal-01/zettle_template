# Zettelkasten
This is my interpretation of the [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) that is talked about in these book(s):
- [How To take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.in/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Technique/dp/3982438802) 
- [A System For Writing](https://www.amazon.in/System-Writing-Unconventional-Note-Making-Zettelkasten-ebook/dp/B0D18J83VB)

I have taken components from various sources to create this vault(I don’t quite remember) but these are few:
- [Cyan Voxel](https://www.youtube.com/@CyanVoxel)
- [bramses](https://github.com/bramses/bramses-highly-opinionated-vault-2023) 
- And all the plugins 


### If on a Time Crunch
No need to read How to take smart notes, as it is repetitive but do read A system for writing by Bob Doto(till chapter 6) 
If even that is hard just pick up `05 - Resources/Bob Doto A SYSTEM FOR WRITING` after opening in obsidian

# Disclaimer
Even if there is a mistake or I find there is a better method to do something I will not be updating this repo
These are outlines only feel free to do what-ever you wish
There might be grammatical and speeling(😉) mistake that is something which I feel is fine in itself 

## To Do:
- Incorporate the best practice and categories from this vault : [kepano](https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian)
- Update the templates in `99 - Meta/00 - Templates`
