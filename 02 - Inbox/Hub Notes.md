# Hub Notes
- Identify the category/topic where there is a cumulation of notes 
- Create a new note that talks about these notes(just use the map of content notes for each category) as a whole
- Identify various chains of thought that we can explore under this `category` 
	- Now list them all out and point to the most prominent note that is the starting of the respective chain of thought
- It serves as a way to manage traffic
- Create only when the topic gets rather big and multiple chain of thoughts
