# Conformation Bias
Whenever we read text we only like to see the parts that we have set out to find, even if the text sometimes is pointing the other way
Hence to get rid of this just keep on adding each and every information that is provided for a topic irrespective of whether they are contradicting our beliefs, as having a [[Growth Mindset]] is important and learning about things as they are without bias is important in this case 

## The best sure-fire way to not fall under this is:[^1]
Do not have a hypothesis that we are trying to prove, just have an open mind and then let the content that we are reading(not just 1 source) to propagate and grow only then finally form the hypothesis the topics itself will talk to you
