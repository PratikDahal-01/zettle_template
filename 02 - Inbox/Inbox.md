# Inbox
There is a directory called Inbox here here all the thoughts that we ad will reside, we will need to process the notes 

At least, process all the notes in Inbox in a week of writing
If they make sense to be added in the current thought and knowledge; directly add to the [[Permanent Notes]] Directory 
If they are on further thought not that important delete/archive the inbox note: Shortcut -> `ctrl + delete` (this will archive the note)
If they are not being used immediately but we fell that it will be used put them in the [[Sleeping]] folder: Shortcut -> `ctrl + shift + s`
