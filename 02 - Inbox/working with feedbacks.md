# Working with Feedbacks
Whenever, we do task be proactive in getting feedback:
- Let the feedback be positive or negative 
- The type of feedback does not matter at all, all that matters is that we identify it and then plan out our next move accordingly 

The best way to see whether we have learnt anything is by: trying to paraphrase and write down what we think we understood from the passage we’ve read 
And when we transfer the note from [[Fleeting Notes]] -> [[Permanent Notes]] this will also be another feedback; as we will try to mend it and link this new notes with notes in the [[Permanent Notes]] folder
