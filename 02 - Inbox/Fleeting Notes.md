# Fleeting Notes
These are the notes which will serve as the entry points to our thoughts that we had over the day or when we read something
They are just a way to remember what we have thought about 

Further classification of fleeting notes have been done as per [[Bob Doto A SYSTEM FOR WRITING]]
Which are:
- [[Inbox]]
- [[Sleeping]]

And once the note has been processed it goes to the [[Permanent Notes |Permanent/Main Notes]] : Shortcut -> `ctrl + shift + p`
