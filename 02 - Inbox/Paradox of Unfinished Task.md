# Paradox of Unfinished task
Some literature say that if we let a task unfinished it will be good in the long run to pick it back up
But some say that they are a source of distraction when we are doing some other task 

Lingering some thoughts will help us get insight in new untrodden land but again they will also inhibit the rest of our task
