# Retrieval of Brain

As our brain tends to forget things because of the limited [[Capacity of the Brain]], we will need a method to retrain as much information as possible. 
As our brains let go of the things time after time the only way we can recall something is using cues
Cues can be anything like:
- sound
- smell 
- sight
- text
that will light up the portion of the brain where the necessary information to process the cue is stored 
The cues can be invoked in mainly 2 ways:
- Involuntarily -> No control over it
- Environmental -> Being in a particular environment like a room


> [!tip] Hence, if for any information we can attach as many cues as possible we would be golden
> When we have a train of thoughts (multiple) that lead to a particular idea we have made several paths to  get to that thought / idea
