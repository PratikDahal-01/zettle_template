# Lattice of Mental Modal 
[[Charlie Munger]] talks about it a lot 
The basic principle of it is that[^1]:
- Understand the very core thing is part of the discipline and incorporate it into our thinking
	- Like [[economics]], can be distilled into one line: Sellers sell & Customers Buy (Supply - Demand)
	- Now whenever we think of something that is somewhat going parallel to economics, just identify how that incorporates the idea of supply-demand
- And how it branches out to the numerous topics in the subject itself
- Be as inter-disciplinary as possible; as being like that will help us identify minute things which we might have missed in the first look
