# New Notes & Old Ideas
When we read something it might seem novel @ first, but when we talk with [[Zettelkasten]] they seem to be a note that has similar essence to an old idea.
As we have limited [[Capacity of the Brain]], we had forgotten it and now we look at it from a new light all-together
Combining these two notes will further enhance our insight to that topic

> [!caution] Do not delete the previous not or over-write it
> Rather than deleting the note, make a further 3rd note that talks about the discrepancies of the two and then state what you think now in it
