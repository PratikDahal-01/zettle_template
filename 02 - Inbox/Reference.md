# Reference Notes
These are the notes that we write about for any particular media we consume like:
- Book
- Video
- Podcast
- etc.

Although it does not have a format currently, but settle to a format depending on the type of media
Think of it like fleeting notes but for media we will store them in `Resource` folder

We can even use our own journals as reference notes
See a good example:
