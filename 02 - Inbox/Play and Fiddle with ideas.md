# Play and fiddle with ideas
As simple as it sounds we want to get an idea and then explore and play with it that is all it is, and it is equally as simple to do:
- Get rid of the underlying context that the idea has been written with 
- And then ~={red}Abstract=~ Find the underlying rule that governs something, which has been used to explore on this idea 

Example:
- Let’s talk about why you want to improve?
	- We Might say that I want:
		- Big House
		- Fancy Car
		- Happiness, etc
	- These all are the context that the statement “I want to improve” was written
	- But if you strip it to the core rule as to why “we want to improve” it is [[Mortality]], the fact that you will die is the reason that we want to improve
		- If we could live forever why would we improve, why would we be better 
- Hence, now we have somewhat of an understanding and the underlying rule for the idea of improvement, we can tinker and play with it
