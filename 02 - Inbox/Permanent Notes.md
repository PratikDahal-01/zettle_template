# Permanent notes 

These are transcribed and linked notes that we will create from [[Inbox]] and [[Sleeping]] Notes

They need to be written as even if I forget the thing I will know what topic it was talking about, it must be that articulate so that I can get straight into the flow of what it meant

They must be atomic in nature as well, meaning that even when looked secluded(without any connection) it must be understandable and talking about just a singular topic ^0da4a9
Making notes atomic will come gradually and it depends person to person (how much information is atomic depends on the person)
