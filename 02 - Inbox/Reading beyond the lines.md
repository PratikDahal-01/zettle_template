# Read Beyond the lines
Whenever we read something there are certain assumptions that are made implicitly by the author of the text do read that
We need not have to stop @each line and try to decipher what are the assumptions that has been made, rather after reading a few pages we stop and then think about what the assumption are and then after that after regular intervals feel free to reassess the assumption as to whether they still fall in line or not

## How
Asking things like this help
- What is not meant when this is said
- What all things are excluded 
- What is the distinction of the things that fall under this claim and so on 

Try to be conscious and do this:
- spot pattern
- Try to understand what the author was thinking 
- Reframe the text:
	- The question
	- The assertion 
	- The information
